        brand.typefaces: "--color-primary"
        rationales:
          typefaces.primary: |
          Museo Sans was chosen to pair with Bebas Neue, having the same thin, clean style to it. Used for body text.
          typesfaces.secondary: |
          Bebas Neue is a clean sans serif font that was chosen for its modern, professional look. Used for Headers, Buttons, links
          colors.primary: |
          Was chosen to give a good base to the site, have the lighter colors pop off the darker background.
          colors.secondary: |
          Was chosen to contrast with the dark background, while still being distinct enough to not get lost in the accent color.
          colors.accent: |
          Was chosen to catch the viewers eye on the page. Would be used for buttons, or points of interaction.

          title: "Buttons"
          description: |
            Buttons should be used in situations where a dramatic, obvious action is required. Should be primary call-to-action, try not to overuse.

            ghost:
              title: "Ghost"
              description: |
              Ghost button is to be used in a situation where the objective isn't necessary to have the user interact with it.
